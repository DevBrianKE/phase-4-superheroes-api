## 🧪 Code Challenge Overview

This project was completed as part of the Phase-4 backend assessment and focuses on building a functional REST API using Flask and SQLAlchemy.

The goal of the challenge was to design a backend service capable of managing superhero data while applying proper database handling, request validation, and API design principles.

### What the Project Covers

- A Flask application organized using an application factory approach
- A `Superhero` database model managed through SQLAlchemy
- Complete CRUD functionality:
  - Adding new superheroes
  - Retrieving all superheroes or a specific superhero by ID
  - Updating existing superhero records
  - Removing superheroes from the database
- Input validation to prevent incomplete or invalid requests
- Clear JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Persistent storage using an SQLite database
- Database schema management through Flask-Migrate
- Manual endpoint testing using `curl` and Postman
- Step-by-step development tracked through meaningful Git commits

### Result

The completed API satisfies all Phase-4 requirements and demonstrates a solid understanding of:

- RESTful API structure
- Database modeling and persistence
- Error handling and validation logic
- Clean, maintainable backend code
- Professional development workflow suitable for real backend projects
